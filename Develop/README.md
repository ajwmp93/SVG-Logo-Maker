#SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description
I wanted to create code that would allow me to create a logo from the terminal line. This would allow me to create at least a nice looking logo inside of a shape, with text and shape color of my choosing, and not require me to hire a graphic designer for a simple logo. This code will allow me to change how many letters I can put in the shapes, as well as easily add new shapes if I want any new shapes. 

## Usage
To use, open the develop folder in the terminal and install inquirer. When you run node shapes.js, it will bring up a series of questions that you need to answer. Once you answer all of the questions, a logo.js file will be created, that when opened in the browser, will display the shape, colors, and text you chose.

## Credits
ChatGPT helped me with the implementation of SVG as we hadn't learned that yet.
